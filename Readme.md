## Symbolic Regressor

Using Symbolic Regression and Random Noise for the generation of one-time pad keys.

### General Todo
+ run binwalk/entropy scan on resulting encrypted string
+ generate entropy graph for encrypted values 
+ look at implementing graphical representation for commands

#### Generator Todo
+ optimise function generation
+ add additional functions
+ look at using tree structure
+ allow more radical changes to prevent algorithm being caught in local minimum.
